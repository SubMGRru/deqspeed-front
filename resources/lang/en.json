    "article_about_methods_aboutspeed": "Internet speed relates to the speed at which data or content moves from the World Wide Web to your home computer, tablet, or smartphone. The speed of this data is measured in megabits per second (Mbps). One megabit is equal to 1024 kilobits. This conversion means that 1 Mbit/s is more than 1,000 times faster than 1 kilobit per second (Kbps). The difference between download and upload speeds can be explained as follows: download speed refers to the speed at which digital data is transferred from the Internet to your computer, while upload speed is the speed at which online data is transferred from your computer to the Internet.",

    "article_about_methods_factors_2_description": "Sometimes the capabilities of a website or the Internet can affect connection speed, causing users to take longer to download, upload, or transfer data. Websites that require large data transfers over the network can make it difficult for you to use them: your Internet connection speed will be insufficient, which will make the data transfer process much longer. If such internet speed limits exist on a third party network, you will not be able to download or upload content at high performance internet speeds when you visit that particular website. <br><i>Example: </i>The service you are trying to access is unexpectedly popular among other users. Due to this set of circumstances, the content transfer time will increase, as the total bandwidth of the service will be distributed among the users.<br>Alternative example: You came to the store, but there was a large queue besides you at the checkout. You will have to go through a queue before being served. If there was no queue, you would be served immediately.",

Internet speed may vary depending on the configuration and performance of computers, hardware, software, applications and other hardware systems. Running multiple devices from the same home network will increase the demand on your home's internet system and may affect the quality of your internet connection, which will increase latency and reduce speed. If you are a mobile network user, then the speed may be reduced due to bad weather, obstacles and the user's unfortunate position (for example, you are too low - on the underground parking level).",
